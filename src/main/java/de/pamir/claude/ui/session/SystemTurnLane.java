/**
 * Which side of {@link SystemSessionService}'s single-system-session lock a caller is on (see
 * docs/plan/phase-9-production-hardening.md S2). {@code INTERACTIVE} callers sit in front of a
 * human waiting on a response (ticket import, git-assist branch/commit-message suggestions,
 * continue-from handoff summaries, library AI-fill) — if a background turn is already holding
 * the system session, they fail fast with a clear "busy" error instead of silently blocking for
 * however long that background turn's own timeout is. {@code BACKGROUND} callers (reflection,
 * service discovery, auto-titling) are fire-and-forget from a human's perspective and can afford
 * to simply wait out their own full timeout for the lock.
